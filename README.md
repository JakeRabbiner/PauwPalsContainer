# PauwPals
Social medial websites and applications are the most common way to connect with friends or a community in this digital age. Yet, websites and applications such as Facebook or Twitter usually receive an influx of excess information that blocks meaningful connections and information the user wants to see. PauwPals is an online social media application with a real-time chat feature that is specifically for the DePauw community. Instead of navigating excess information from a website, PauwPals creates a safe space where new DePauw students, faculty, and staff can meet, post updates about the school, find new roommates, and find other relevant information the DePauw community wants to know.
